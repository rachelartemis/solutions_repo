Horizontal Motion \\(\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = 0\\) \u27f6 First integration \u27f6 \\(\\frac{dx}{dt} = v_{0x}\\) (a constant) Second integration \u27f6 \\(x = v_{0x} t + x_0\\) Since \\(v_{0x} = v_0 \\cos\\theta\\) , we get: \\[ x = v_0 \\cos\\theta \\cdot t \\] 2. Vertical Motion \\(\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} = -g\\) \u27f6 First integration \u27f6 \\(\\frac{dy}{dt} = -gt + v_{0y}\\) Second integration \u27f6 \\(y = -\\frac{1}{2}gt^2 + v_{0y} t + y_0\\) Using \\(v_{0y} = v_0 \\sin\\theta\\) , we obtain: \\[ y = -\\frac{1}{2}gt^2 + v_0 \\sin\\theta \\cdot t + y_0 \\] Step 2: Variety of Solutions Based on Initial Conditions Projectile motion is influenced by key initial parameters: - Initial speed ( \\(v_0\\) ) : Affects the overall distance and maximum height. - Launch angle ( \\(\\theta\\) ) : Determines range, with a peak at \\(\\theta = 45^\\circ\\) due to \\(\\sin 2\\theta\\) dependence. - Initial height ( \\(y_0\\) ) : Impacts the total flight time and final distance traveled. Adjusting these conditions leads to various trajectories \u2014 a reflection of how simple physics laws produce diverse outcomes. Real-World Uses of Projectile Motion 1. Uneven Terrain When launch and landing heights differ, the vertical position is: \\[y = y_0 + v_0 \\sin\\theta \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2\\] To determine range, solve for \\(t\\) when \\(y = 0\\) , which typically involves solving a quadratic equation. 2. Air Drag Air resistance causes deviations from ideal parabolic motion. The drag force is defined as: \\[\\vec{F}_d = - \\frac{1}{2} C_d \\rho A v^2 \\hat{v}\\] This leads to complex, non-linear differential equations that are often handled with numerical techniques. 3. Wind and Variable Conditions Factors like wind or non-uniform gravity influence the launch parameters. For instance, wind modifies both horizontal and vertical components of motion. 4. Application Examples Sports : Air drag alters how balls move in soccer or basketball. Military : Projectile and missile paths are calculated considering resistance and gravity. Aerospace : Spaceflight must take varying gravity and drag into account. Engineering : Trajectories in controlled demolitions require detailed predictions. 5. Computational Approaches In scenarios with drag or non-constant gravity, numerical methods such as Euler\u2019s or Runge-Kutta techniques approximate the motion effectively. Analysis of the Range Horizontal Range and Angle of Projection The horizontal range \\(R\\) is the total distance a projectile travels horizontally before returning to the original height ( \\(y = y_0\\) ). Assuming \\(y_0 = 0\\) , the total flight time \\(T\\) is: \\[ T = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin \\theta}{g} \\] Thus, the range is: \\[ R = v_0 \\cos \\theta \\cdot T = v_0 \\cos \\theta \\cdot \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin \\theta}{g} \\] Simplified: \\[ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} \\] The outcome depends heavily on the launch angle: Maximum range occurs when \\(\\sin(2\\theta) = 1\\) , i.e., at \\(\\theta = 45^\\circ\\) . The function \\(\\sin(2\\theta)\\) is symmetric around 45\u00b0, so: \\(R(30^\\circ) = R(60^\\circ)\\) \\(R(10^\\circ) = R(80^\\circ)\\) Role of Other Parameters 1. Initial Speed \\(v_0\\) From the range formula: \\[ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} \\] The range increases quadratically with \\(v_0\\) . Doubling \\(v_0\\) multiplies the range by four. More speed results in longer airtime and faster movement. 2. Gravitational Acceleration \\(g\\) Range is inversely related to \\(g\\) . On the Moon (with lower \\(g\\) ), projectiles travel significantly farther. Example: Earth: \\(g \\approx 9.8\\, \\text{m/s}^2\\) Moon: \\(g \\approx 1.6\\, \\text{m/s}^2 \\Rightarrow R_{\\text{moon}} \\approx 6.1 \\times R_{\\text{earth}}\\) Summary Range is influenced by launch angle via the \\(\\sin(2\\theta)\\) term. It peaks at 45\u00b0 and is symmetric around that angle. Greater initial velocity boosts the range significantly. Weaker gravity enables longer travel distances. Understanding these principles enables optimization of projectile paths \u2014 useful in fields ranging from athletics to orbital mechanics. Plot showing how the range varies with the angle of projection. Analysis of the Graphs Graph (a) This graph shows trajectories for different initial speeds (30 m/s, 40 m/s, 50 m/s) at an angle of 45\u00b0 . Observations: Greater speed yields higher peak height and longer range. Graph (b) This graph presents motion for various launch angles (15\u00b0, 30\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 60\u00b0, 75\u00b0) at a fixed speed of 50 m/s . Key points: 45\u00b0 yields the greatest range . Other angles lead to shorter horizontal travel despite the same speed. 45\u00b0 Results in Maximum Range Range is determined by: \\[ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} \\] Key Takeaways: Sine Function Impact : Since \\(\\sin(2\\theta)\\) maxes out at 1 (when \\(2\\theta = 90^\\circ\\) ), the optimal angle is \\(\\theta = 45^\\circ\\) . Symmetry : \\(\\sin(2\\theta)\\) has symmetry about 45\u00b0, so: \\(R(30^\\circ) = R(60^\\circ)\\) \\(R(15^\\circ) = R(75^\\circ)\\) Practical Use: The 45\u00b0 launch angle is ideal for maximizing horizontal distance \u2014 explaining its strategic use in sports (e.g., javelin throwing) and military ballistics. Effect of Initial Velocity on Range: Increasing velocity significantly boosts the range due to the square dependence Effect of Gravity on Range: Lower gravity environments enable longer distances, while stronger gravity shortens them My Colab","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#problem-1","text":"","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#theoretical-foundation-of-projectile-motion","text":"","title":"Theoretical Foundation of Projectile Motion"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#step-1-deriving-the-governing-equations","text":"Projectile motion is based on Newton\u2019s Second Law: \\[ \\vec{F} = m\\vec{a} \\] In the case of a projectile undergoing freefall and assuming no air resistance, the only acting force is gravity, directed downward: \\[ F_y = -mg, \\quad F_x = 0 \\] This leads to the following equations of motion: \\[ m \\frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} = 0 \\] \\[ m \\frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} = -mg \\] Dividing both sides by \\(m\\) and integrating twice:","title":"Step 1: Deriving the Governing Equations"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#1-horizontal-motion","text":"\\(\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = 0\\) \u27f6 First integration \u27f6 \\(\\frac{dx}{dt} = v_{0x}\\) (a constant) Second integration \u27f6 \\(x = v_{0x} t + x_0\\) Since \\(v_{0x} = v_0 \\cos\\theta\\) , we get: \\[ x = v_0 \\cos\\theta \\cdot t \\]","title":"1.

Governing Differential Equation of a Forced Damped Pendulum The motion of a pendulum under the influence of damping and an external driving force is described by the nonlinear second-order differential equation: \\[ \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + b \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\frac{g}{L} \\sin\\theta = A \\cos(\\omega t) \\] Here: - \\(\\theta(t)\\) is the angular position as a function of time, - \\(b\\) is the damping constant, - \\(g\\) is gravitational acceleration, - \\(L\\) is the pendulum length, - \\(A\\) represents the amplitude of the external periodic force, - \\(\\omega\\) denotes the angular frequency of the driving force. This equation is nonlinear due to the \\(\\sin\\theta\\) term. II. Linear Approximation: Small-Angle Solution For small oscillations where \\(\\theta\\) is small (in radians), we apply the approximation: \\[ \\sin\\theta \\approx \\theta \\] This linearizes the equation: \\[ \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + b \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\frac{g}{L} \\theta = A \\cos(\\omega t) \\] This is mathematically equivalent to a forced, damped harmonic oscillator: \\[ \\ddot{\\theta} + 2\\beta \\dot{\\theta} + \\omega_0^2 \\theta = A \\cos(\\omega t) \\] where: - \\(\\omega_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{L}}\\) is the undamped natural frequency, - \\(2\\beta = b\\) denotes the damping rate. Steady-State Particular Solution The long-term solution of this system is: \\[ \\theta_p(t) = \\theta_0 \\cos(\\omega t - \\delta) \\] with: \\[ \\theta_0 = \\frac{A}{\\sqrt{(\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2)^2 + 4\\beta^2 \\omega^2}}, \\quad \\tan\\delta = \\frac{2\\beta \\omega}{\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2} \\] This illustrates how both amplitude and phase lag are influenced by the driving frequency and damping. III. Resonance Behavior and Energy Aspects Resonant Response Resonance manifests when the driving frequency nears the natural frequency: \\[ \\omega \\approx \\omega_0 \\] However, damping causes a shift, and the maximum amplitude is observed at: \\[ \\omega_{\\text{res}} = \\sqrt{\\omega_0^2 - 2\\beta^2} \\] Energy Dynamics At resonance, energy input from the driver is maximally efficient. Low damping may lead to energy accumulation, possibly damaging mechanical systems. High damping reduces energy build-up, controlling oscillation amplitudes. IV. Impact of System Parameters Damping Factor ( \\(b\\) ) Large \\(b\\) : Overdamped; slow return to equilibrium, no oscillations. Moderate \\(b\\) : Damped oscillations that decay gradually. Small \\(b\\) : Persistent oscillations; greater potential for resonance or chaos. External Force Amplitude ( \\(A\\) ) Low values : Predictable, nearly harmonic motion. Medium values : System begins to display nonlinear effects. High values : Can result in chaotic motion and sensitivity to initial conditions. Driving Frequency ( \\(\\omega\\) ) Low \\(\\omega\\) : The system closely follows the driver. Near \\(\\omega_0\\) : System exhibits peak amplitude (resonance). High \\(\\omega\\) : Oscillations become irregular or unstable. V. From Predictability to Chaos Phase Space Visualization Orderly motion \u2192 smooth loops (limit cycles). Chaotic regime \u2192 irregular, non-repeating trajectories. Bifurcations and Chaos Onset System transitions via period doubling and bifurcations as \\(A\\) increases. Eventually leads to a chaotic state characterized by unpredictable long-term behavior. Lyapunov Exponent Positive Lyapunov exponents signify chaotic dynamics due to extreme sensitivity to initial conditions. VI. Real-World Relevance Energy Scavenging Systems Pendulum-like devices in piezoelectric setups can convert vibrations into electricity. Structural Engineering Structures such as bridges are analyzed using this model to prevent oscillation-induced collapses. Electrical Analogues The damped driven pendulum has direct parallels in RLC electrical circuits used in communications and signal processing. VII. Visual Analysis of Parameter Effects 1. Varying Damping Coefficient As damping increases, the pendulum's amplitude diminishes and oscillations decay faster. 2. Changing Driving Amplitude Larger \\(A\\) values amplify motion and introduce nonlinear effects. 3. Adjusting Driving Frequency At resonance, oscillations peak; at high frequencies, they become erratic. VIII.

Examples: Earth: 1 year at 1 AU Mars: ~1.88 years at ~1.52 AU Conclusion Kepler\u2019s law is validated through observations across our Solar System, aiding calculations of planetary masses and trajectories. Extensions to Elliptical Orbits For elliptical orbits, the square of the orbital period remains proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis \\(a\\) : \\[ T^2 \\propto a^3 \\] Applications Moons and Planets: Used for satellites, moons, and exoplanets orbiting their primary bodies. Binary Star Systems: Allows estimation of combined masses in stellar pairs. Complex Systems: Multi-body interactions require additional considerations but can still adhere to Kepler\u2019s principles. Relativistic Effects Near massive objects (e.g., black holes), modifications from General Relativity adjust predictions from Kepler\u2019s Third Law. Conclusion The law remains versatile across various orbital configurations, reaffirming its universality. Simulation Verification of Kepler\u2019s Law General Observations Kepler's Third Law links orbital periods to the masses and distances in celestial systems. It reveals that larger central masses correspond to shorter orbital periods for the same distance. A logarithmic graph illustrates how varying the mass of the central body impacts the relationship between radius and period.
