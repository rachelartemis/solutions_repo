Horizontal Motion \\(\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = 0\\) \u27f6 First integration \u27f6 \\(\\frac{dx}{dt} = v_{0x}\\) (a constant) Second integration \u27f6 \\(x = v_{0x} t + x_0\\) Since \\(v_{0x} = v_0 \\cos\\theta\\) , we get: \\[ x = v_0 \\cos\\theta \\cdot t \\] 2. Vertical Motion \\(\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} = -g\\) \u27f6 First integration \u27f6 \\(\\frac{dy}{dt} = -gt + v_{0y}\\) Second integration \u27f6 \\(y = -\\frac{1}{2}gt^2 + v_{0y} t + y_0\\) Using \\(v_{0y} = v_0 \\sin\\theta\\) , we obtain: \\[ y = -\\frac{1}{2}gt^2 + v_0 \\sin\\theta \\cdot t + y_0 \\] Step 2: Variety of Solutions Based on Initial Conditions Projectile motion is influenced by key initial parameters: - Initial speed ( \\(v_0\\) ) : Affects the overall distance and maximum height. - Launch angle ( \\(\\theta\\) ) : Determines range, with a peak at \\(\\theta = 45^\\circ\\) due to \\(\\sin 2\\theta\\) dependence. - Initial height ( \\(y_0\\) ) : Impacts the total flight time and final distance traveled. Adjusting these conditions leads to various trajectories \u2014 a reflection of how simple physics laws produce diverse outcomes. Real-World Uses of Projectile Motion 1. Uneven Terrain When launch and landing heights differ, the vertical position is: \\[y = y_0 + v_0 \\sin\\theta \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2\\] To determine range, solve for \\(t\\) when \\(y = 0\\) , which typically involves solving a quadratic equation. 2. Air Drag Air resistance causes deviations from ideal parabolic motion. The drag force is defined as: \\[\\vec{F}_d = - \\frac{1}{2} C_d \\rho A v^2 \\hat{v}\\] This leads to complex, non-linear differential equations that are often handled with numerical techniques. 3. Wind and Variable Conditions Factors like wind or non-uniform gravity influence the launch parameters. For instance, wind modifies both horizontal and vertical components of motion. 4. Application Examples Sports : Air drag alters how balls move in soccer or basketball. Military : Projectile and missile paths are calculated considering resistance and gravity. Aerospace : Spaceflight must take varying gravity and drag into account. Engineering : Trajectories in controlled demolitions require detailed predictions. 5. Computational Approaches In scenarios with drag or non-constant gravity, numerical methods such as Euler\u2019s or Runge-Kutta techniques approximate the motion effectively. Analysis of the Range Horizontal Range and Angle of Projection The horizontal range \\(R\\) is the total distance a projectile travels horizontally before returning to the original height ( \\(y = y_0\\) ). Assuming \\(y_0 = 0\\) , the total flight time \\(T\\) is: \\[ T = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin \\theta}{g} \\] Thus, the range is: \\[ R = v_0 \\cos \\theta \\cdot T = v_0 \\cos \\theta \\cdot \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin \\theta}{g} \\] Simplified: \\[ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} \\] The outcome depends heavily on the launch angle: Maximum range occurs when \\(\\sin(2\\theta) = 1\\) , i.e., at \\(\\theta = 45^\\circ\\) . The function \\(\\sin(2\\theta)\\) is symmetric around 45\u00b0, so: \\(R(30^\\circ) = R(60^\\circ)\\) \\(R(10^\\circ) = R(80^\\circ)\\) Role of Other Parameters 1. Initial Speed \\(v_0\\) From the range formula: \\[ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} \\] The range increases quadratically with \\(v_0\\) . Doubling \\(v_0\\) multiplies the range by four. More speed results in longer airtime and faster movement. 2. Gravitational Acceleration \\(g\\) Range is inversely related to \\(g\\) . On the Moon (with lower \\(g\\) ), projectiles travel significantly farther. Example: Earth: \\(g \\approx 9.8\\, \\text{m/s}^2\\) Moon: \\(g \\approx 1.6\\, \\text{m/s}^2 \\Rightarrow R_{\\text{moon}} \\approx 6.1 \\times R_{\\text{earth}}\\) Summary Range is influenced by launch angle via the \\(\\sin(2\\theta)\\) term. It peaks at 45\u00b0 and is symmetric around that angle. Greater initial velocity boosts the range significantly. Weaker gravity enables longer travel distances. Understanding these principles enables optimization of projectile paths \u2014 useful in fields ranging from athletics to orbital mechanics. Plot showing how the range varies with the angle of projection. Analysis of the Graphs Graph (a) This graph shows trajectories for different initial speeds (30 m/s, 40 m/s, 50 m/s) at an angle of 45\u00b0 . Observations: Greater speed yields higher peak height and longer range. Graph (b) This graph presents motion for various launch angles (15\u00b0, 30\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 60\u00b0, 75\u00b0) at a fixed speed of 50 m/s . Key points: 45\u00b0 yields the greatest range . Other angles lead to shorter horizontal travel despite the same speed. 45\u00b0 Results in Maximum Range Range is determined by: \\[ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} \\] Key Takeaways: Sine Function Impact : Since \\(\\sin(2\\theta)\\) maxes out at 1 (when \\(2\\theta = 90^\\circ\\) ), the optimal angle is \\(\\theta = 45^\\circ\\) . Symmetry : \\(\\sin(2\\theta)\\) has symmetry about 45\u00b0, so: \\(R(30^\\circ) = R(60^\\circ)\\) \\(R(15^\\circ) = R(75^\\circ)\\) Practical Use: The 45\u00b0 launch angle is ideal for maximizing horizontal distance \u2014 explaining its strategic use in sports (e.g., javelin throwing) and military ballistics. Effect of Initial Velocity on Range: Increasing velocity significantly boosts the range due to the square dependence Effect of Gravity on Range: Lower gravity environments enable longer distances, while stronger gravity shortens them My Colab","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#problem-1","text":"","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#theoretical-foundation-of-projectile-motion","text":"","title":"Theoretical Foundation of Projectile Motion"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#step-1-deriving-the-governing-equations","text":"Projectile motion is based on Newton\u2019s Second Law: \\[ \\vec{F} = m\\vec{a} \\] In the case of a projectile undergoing freefall and assuming no air resistance, the only acting force is gravity, directed downward: \\[ F_y = -mg, \\quad F_x = 0 \\] This leads to the following equations of motion: \\[ m \\frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} = 0 \\] \\[ m \\frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} = -mg \\] Dividing both sides by \\(m\\) and integrating twice:","title":"Step 1: Deriving the Governing Equations"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#1-horizontal-motion","text":"\\(\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = 0\\) \u27f6 First integration \u27f6 \\(\\frac{dx}{dt} = v_{0x}\\) (a constant) Second integration \u27f6 \\(x = v_{0x} t + x_0\\) Since \\(v_{0x} = v_0 \\cos\\theta\\) , we get: \\[ x = v_0 \\cos\\theta \\cdot t \\]","title":"1.

Governing Differential Equation of a Forced Damped Pendulum The motion of a pendulum under the influence of damping and an external driving force is described by the nonlinear second-order differential equation: \\[ \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + b \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\frac{g}{L} \\sin\\theta = A \\cos(\\omega t) \\] Here: - \\(\\theta(t)\\) is the angular position as a function of time, - \\(b\\) is the damping constant, - \\(g\\) is gravitational acceleration, - \\(L\\) is the pendulum length, - \\(A\\) represents the amplitude of the external periodic force, - \\(\\omega\\) denotes the angular frequency of the driving force. This equation is nonlinear due to the \\(\\sin\\theta\\) term. II. Linear Approximation: Small-Angle Solution For small oscillations where \\(\\theta\\) is small (in radians), we apply the approximation: \\[ \\sin\\theta \\approx \\theta \\] This linearizes the equation: \\[ \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + b \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\frac{g}{L} \\theta = A \\cos(\\omega t) \\] This is mathematically equivalent to a forced, damped harmonic oscillator: \\[ \\ddot{\\theta} + 2\\beta \\dot{\\theta} + \\omega_0^2 \\theta = A \\cos(\\omega t) \\] where: - \\(\\omega_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{L}}\\) is the undamped natural frequency, - \\(2\\beta = b\\) denotes the damping rate. Steady-State Particular Solution The long-term solution of this system is: \\[ \\theta_p(t) = \\theta_0 \\cos(\\omega t - \\delta) \\] with: \\[ \\theta_0 = \\frac{A}{\\sqrt{(\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2)^2 + 4\\beta^2 \\omega^2}}, \\quad \\tan\\delta = \\frac{2\\beta \\omega}{\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2} \\] This illustrates how both amplitude and phase lag are influenced by the driving frequency and damping. III. Resonance Behavior and Energy Aspects Resonant Response Resonance manifests when the driving frequency nears the natural frequency: \\[ \\omega \\approx \\omega_0 \\] However, damping causes a shift, and the maximum amplitude is observed at: \\[ \\omega_{\\text{res}} = \\sqrt{\\omega_0^2 - 2\\beta^2} \\] Energy Dynamics At resonance, energy input from the driver is maximally efficient. Low damping may lead to energy accumulation, possibly damaging mechanical systems. High damping reduces energy build-up, controlling oscillation amplitudes. IV. Impact of System Parameters Damping Factor ( \\(b\\) ) Large \\(b\\) : Overdamped; slow return to equilibrium, no oscillations. Moderate \\(b\\) : Damped oscillations that decay gradually. Small \\(b\\) : Persistent oscillations; greater potential for resonance or chaos. External Force Amplitude ( \\(A\\) ) Low values : Predictable, nearly harmonic motion. Medium values : System begins to display nonlinear effects. High values : Can result in chaotic motion and sensitivity to initial conditions. Driving Frequency ( \\(\\omega\\) ) Low \\(\\omega\\) : The system closely follows the driver. Near \\(\\omega_0\\) : System exhibits peak amplitude (resonance). High \\(\\omega\\) : Oscillations become irregular or unstable. V. From Predictability to Chaos Phase Space Visualization Orderly motion \u2192 smooth loops (limit cycles). Chaotic regime \u2192 irregular, non-repeating trajectories. Bifurcations and Chaos Onset System transitions via period doubling and bifurcations as \\(A\\) increases. Eventually leads to a chaotic state characterized by unpredictable long-term behavior. Lyapunov Exponent Positive Lyapunov exponents signify chaotic dynamics due to extreme sensitivity to initial conditions. VI. Real-World Relevance Energy Scavenging Systems Pendulum-like devices in piezoelectric setups can convert vibrations into electricity. Structural Engineering Structures such as bridges are analyzed using this model to prevent oscillation-induced collapses. Electrical Analogues The damped driven pendulum has direct parallels in RLC electrical circuits used in communications and signal processing. VII. Visual Analysis of Parameter Effects 1. Varying Damping Coefficient As damping increases, the pendulum's amplitude diminishes and oscillations decay faster. 2. Changing Driving Amplitude Larger \\(A\\) values amplify motion and introduce nonlinear effects. 3. Adjusting Driving Frequency At resonance, oscillations peak; at high frequencies, they become erratic. VIII.

These velocities\u2014referred to as the first, second, and third cosmic velocities\u2014govern the energy thresholds for orbiting planets, escaping celestial bodies, and departing from star systems. 1. First Cosmic Velocity: Orbital Speed Explanation : The first cosmic velocity refers to the lowest speed necessary for an object to maintain a circular orbit around a planet or similar celestial body without propulsion assistance . Physical Insight : Achieving this speed means the object continuously \"falls\" towards the planet but never reaches the surface, forming a stable orbit. The velocity depends on the gravitational pull and the planet's radius but is independent of the object's mass. On Earth : Typical Speed : Approximately 7.9 km/s \\(~28,400 km/h\\) Orbit Level : Near-Earth orbits, such as Low Earth Orbit \\(LEO\\) Examples : Satellites like GPS systems and the ISS 2. Second Cosmic Velocity: Escape Speed Definition : The second cosmic velocity is the minimum speed an object must reach to break free from a planet's gravitational pull without requiring further propulsion. Key Features : The object\u2019s kinetic energy at this velocity equals its gravitational potential energy. Once achieved, the object will travel infinitely far from the planet, assuming no other forces act upon it. For Earth : Typical Speed : About 11.2 km/s \\(~40,320 km/h\\) Use Cases : Lunar exploration, interplanetary missions 3. Third Cosmic Velocity: Interstellar Escape Speed Explanation : The third cosmic velocity is the minimum velocity required to leave the gravitational field of the Sun entirely, starting from Earth's orbit. Insights : A spacecraft must first escape Earth\u2019s gravity, then attain enough velocity relative to the Sun to overcome its gravitational influence. This velocity accounts for Earth\u2019s orbital motion around the Sun.

Satellite Operations Purpose : Achieving the first cosmic velocity ensures satellites can remain in stable orbits, vital for communication, weather monitoring, and navigation. Example : GPS satellites operate at speeds near Earth\u2019s orbital velocity. 2. Planetary Missions Purpose : Escape velocity is essential for missions leaving Earth to explore other celestial bodies. Example : Mars rover launches required exceeding Earth\u2019s second cosmic velocity. 3.

My Colab","title":"Conclusion"},{"location":"1%20Physics/4%20Electromagnetism/Problem_1/","text":"Problem 1 1. Systems Where the Lorentz Force Plays a Key Role Below are several important systems and devices that critically depend on the Lorentz force: A. Particle Accelerators Basic Principle : Charged particles such as electrons or protons are boosted in energy using electric fields and guided using magnetic fields. Function of Lorentz Force : \\(\\vec{F} = q\\vec{E}\\) : The electric field accelerates particles by increasing their speed. \\(\\vec{F} = q\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}\\) : The magnetic component alters the particle's direction, often forcing it into circular or spiral paths. Example : In the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), extremely strong magnets direct high-speed protons along curved trajectories. B. Mass Spectrometry Functionality : Differentiates ions based on their ratio of mass to electric charge. Role of Lorentz Force : As ions move through electric or magnetic fields, they are deflected depending on their charge and velocity. The bending of their path reveals data about their mass. Important Formula : \\( \\(r = \\frac{mv}{qB}\\) \\) Uses : Identifying unknown chemical substances and isotopes. C. Plasma Control in Fusion Devices (Tokamaks) Operation : Uses magnetic fields to enclose high-temperature plasma within a donut-shaped chamber. Effect of Lorentz Force : Magnetic fields keep the ionized gas particles from contacting the reactor's inner walls. Significance : This containment is necessary for maintaining the conditions needed for nuclear fusion. D. Cathode Ray Tubes (CRTs) Working Mechanism : Beams of electrons are manipulated using fields to form images on a screen. Lorentz Force Action : Electric fields speed up the electrons. Magnetic fields adjust their direction to target different areas of the screen. E. Astrophysical Interactions (e.g., Solar Wind and Magnetic Fields) Scenario : Solar particles interact with magnetic fields of planets (like Earth). Influence of Lorentz Force : Determines how charged cosmic particles move in space. Responsible for phenomena such as auroras and geomagnetic storms. 2. Importance of Electric ( \\(\\vec{E}\\) ) and Magnetic ( \\(\\vec{B}\\) ) Fields Electric Fields ( \\(\\vec{E}\\) ) Straight-line Acceleration : Provide energy to particles by pushing them in the field\u2019s direction. Effect : Modify the particle\u2019s speed without necessarily altering its direction (in uniform fields). Common Uses : Launching particles from rest. Accelerating charged particles in a straight line. Magnetic Fields ( \\(\\vec{B}\\) ) Curving Paths : Redirect particle motion without increasing speed. Motion Type : Cause particles to move in circles or spirals because the force acts at a right angle to the motion. Applications : Directing and shaping beams in instruments. Holding plasma in place inside reactors. Particle Moving in a Magnetic Field Interaction of Both Fields The complete Lorentz force equation is: \\[\\vec{F} = q\\vec{E} + q\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}\\] This enables complex particle behavior: Cross-field Drift : With perpendicular \\(\\vec{E}\\) and \\(\\vec{B}\\) fields, the particle drifts sideways to both. Cyclotron Motion : Pure magnetic field causes circular motion. Helical Paths : When both fields act together, the particle spirals along the magnetic field lines. Exploring Key Parameters Lorentz Force Formula \\[ \\vec{F} = q (\\vec{E} + \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}) \\] Where: - \\(q\\) : electric charge - \\(m\\) : mass of the particle - \\(\\vec{E}\\) : electric field - \\(\\vec{B}\\) : magnetic field - \\(\\vec{v}\\) : particle\u2019s velocity 1. Field Magnitudes: \\(\\vec{E}\\) and \\(\\vec{B}\\) Electric Field ( \\(\\vec{E}\\) ) : Acceleration from this field is: \\(\\vec{a}_E = \\frac{q\\vec{E}}{m}\\) This results in linear motion along the field direction. Magnetic Field ( \\(\\vec{B}\\) ) : Triggers circular or spiral movement if the velocity is not aligned with the field. Radius of the circle: \\(r = \\frac{mv}{|q||\\vec{B}|}\\) Frequency of rotation: \\(f = \\frac{|q||\\vec{B}|}{2\\pi m}\\) Observe : - Larger \\(B\\) compresses the spiral path. - Stronger \\(E\\) stretches the particle\u2019s path along its field. 2. Initial Velocity \\(\\vec{v}\\) When \\(\\vec{v} \\parallel \\vec{B}\\) : Particle proceeds in a straight line. When \\(\\vec{v} \\perp \\vec{B}\\) : It moves in a circle. When \\(\\vec{v}\\) has both parallel and perpendicular parts: A helix forms. Try Changing : - Angle of \\(\\vec{v}\\) transitions motion type from straight to circular to spiral. 3. Charge \\(q\\) and Mass \\(m\\) Charge ( \\(q\\) ) : The direction of force flips if the sign of \\(q\\) changes. A higher charge boosts the force. Mass ( \\(m\\) ) : Influences acceleration (more mass = more inertia). Heavier particles move in wider circles and respond slower. Investigate : - Compare motion of particles with opposite charge signs. - See how heavier particles rotate more sluggishly and broadly. Charged Particle Motion Under Electric and Magnetic Influence Understanding the Larmor Radius and Drift Velocity 1. Larmor (Cyclotron) Radius This radius describes how far a particle curves when it moves at a right angle to a magnetic field. Formula: \\[ r_L = \\frac{mv}{|q|B} \\] \\(m\\) : mass of the particle \\(v\\) : speed perpendicular to the magnetic field \\(q\\) : electric charge \\(B\\) : magnetic field strength Interpretation: Higher \\(B\\) \u2192 Tighter curve. Larger \\(m\\) or \\(v\\) \u2192 Wider curve. Indicates the size of the circular/spiral motion in a magnetic field. 2. Drift Velocity Charged particles also move with a drift velocity when exposed to both electric and magnetic fields, especially in plasmas or conducting materials. Formula: \\[ \\vec{v}_D = \\frac{\\vec{E}}{B} \\] \\(\\vec{E}\\) : electric field vector \\(B\\) : magnetic field magnitude Meaning: Drift occurs at a right angle to both fields. In crossed-field conditions, the spiral path slowly shifts in the electric field\u2019s direction. Combining Larmor Radius and Drift In mixed fields, the motion becomes a helix : Circle radius = Larmor radius. Entire spiral shifts due to drift velocity.

Construct a square with a side length of 2, centered at the origin. This square spans from \\(-1\\) to \\(1\\) along both the x and y axes. Enclose a unit circle (radius \\(r = 1\\) ) inside this square, also centered at the origin. We then generate random points \\((x, y)\\) , where \\(x, y \\in [-1, 1]\\) , ensuring they are uniformly spread across the square. Areas of Interest: Square Area : \\( \\(A_{\\text{square}} = 2 \\times 2 = 4\\) \\) Circle Area : \\( \\(A_{\\text{circle}} = \\pi \\times r^2 = \\pi \\times 1^2 = \\pi\\) \\) The likelihood that a randomly chosen point lands inside the circle is expressed as the ratio of their areas: \\[ P(\\text{inside circle}) = \\frac{A_{\\text{circle}}}{A_{\\text{square}}} = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\] Thus, by generating a large number of random points and tallying those that fall within the circle, we can expect: \\[ \\frac{\\text{Points inside circle}}{\\text{Total points}} \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\] Deriving the Estimation Formula From the theoretical relationship: \\[ \\frac{\\text{Points inside circle}}{\\text{Total points}} \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\] We rearrange to estimate \u03c0: \\[ \\pi \\approx 4 \\times \\frac{\\text{Points inside circle}}{\\text{Total points}} \\] This is the key formula for Monte Carlo \u03c0 estimation . Determining If a Point Is Within the Circle For any randomly chosen point \\((x, y)\\) , it is inside the unit circle if: \\[ x^2 + y^2 \\leq 1 \\] Hence, for each generated point, calculate \\(x^2 + y^2\\) . If the result is less than or equal to 1, the point is considered inside the circle . Steps for Monte Carlo Simulation to Approximate \u03c0 The simulation proceeds as follows: Generate \\(N\\) random points \\((x, y)\\) within the square defined by \\([-1, 1] \\times [-1, 1]\\) . Count how many of these points lie within the circle using the condition \\(x^2 + y^2 \\leq 1\\) . Estimate \u03c0 using the formula: \\[ \\pi \\approx 4 \\times \\frac{\\text{Points inside circle}}{\\text{Total points}} \\] Visualizing Monte Carlo Points To better understand the Monte Carlo approach for approximating \u03c0: Plot all the randomly generated points \\((x, y)\\) inside the square. Mark points inside the circle ( \\(x^2 + y^2 \\leq 1\\) ) in blue . Mark points outside the circle in red . Display the unit circle inscribed within a square of side 2, centered at the origin. This visualization provides an intuitive understanding of how the ratio of areas is linked to \u03c0. Convergence and Accuracy Analysis Monte Carlo methods rely on statistical principles, improving in precision as the sample size increases. Here\u2019s what we do: Conduct simulations with progressively larger numbers of random points \\(N\\) . Observe how the approximation of \u03c0 converges over iterations. Study the rate of convergence and computational factors . Behavior of Convergence Let \\(E(N)\\) represent the estimated value of \u03c0 after generating \\(N\\) random points. By the Law of Large Numbers , we anticipate: \\[ \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} E(N) = \\pi \\] The standard error (typical deviation from the true value) reduces as: \\[ \\text{Error} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}} \\] This implies that reducing the error by a factor of 10 requires increasing the number of points by 100 times. Considerations for Computation Advantages : Straightforward and simple to implement. Can efficiently utilize parallel computing. Works well even for complex geometric regions. Disadvantages : Convergence rate is slow ( \\(\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{N})\\) ). Requires a very large number of samples for high accuracy (e.g., millions of points). Simulation: Visualizing Convergence We simulate \u03c0 approximation for a series of \\(N\\) values and chart the outcomes to observe convergence behavior. Estimating \u03c0 via Buffon\u2019s Needle Conceptual Framework Buffon\u2019s Needle Problem The Buffon\u2019s Needle problem is a classic geometric probability challenge, introduced by French mathematician Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in the 18th century. The scenario is: A floor is marked with equally spaced parallel lines , separated by a distance \\(d\\) . A needle of length \\(\\ell\\) is randomly dropped onto the floor. The task is to compute the likelihood of the needle intersecting one of the lines. Interestingly, this probability involves \u03c0 , allowing us to estimate its value. Conditions The needle length \\(\\ell\\) must satisfy \\(\\ell \\leq d\\) . The needle is dropped with a random position and orientation . Define: \\(N\\) = total needle drops. \\(C\\) = occurrences where the needle crosses a line.

The needle crosses a line if half the needle projects beyond the nearest line , i.e.: \\[ x \\leq \\frac{\\ell}{2} \\sin\\theta \\] The likelihood of this event (over all possible \\((x, \\theta)\\) pairs) is calculated as: \\[ P(\\text{cross}) = \\frac{2\\ell}{\\pi d} \\] Estimating \u03c0 Experimentally If we perform \\(N\\) trials and record \\(C\\) crossings, the empirical probability aligns with the theoretical one: \\[ \\frac{C}{N} \\approx \\frac{2\\ell}{\\pi d} \\] Rearranging to solve for \u03c0: \\[ \\pi \\approx \\frac{2\\ell N}{dC} \\] Final Formula for \u03c0 Approximation Let: \\(\\ell\\) = length of the needle. \\(d\\) = spacing between lines. \\(N\\) = number of needle drops. \\(C\\) = number of crossings observed.
